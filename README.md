# Three.js Sphere Demo

This project is a simple, yet captivating demonstration of the power of Three.js for creating immersive 3D web experiences. Following a comprehensive [Three.js crash course for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OwJV2xL8M8), I developed an interactive 3D sphere rendered beautifully within the browser.

The tutorial guided me through the essentials of Three.jsâ€”a high-level JavaScript library that builds on WebGL. It showed how with just a few lines of code, we can create sophisticated 3D graphics that are web-friendly. In this project, I've created a scene, added a geometric sphere, and integrated lighting to give the sphere depth and dimension.

Additionally, a camera is set up to control the perspective, and a WebGL renderer is used to bring the scene to life. The final result is a responsive 3D sphere that's a starting point for more complex Three.js projects and serves as a testament to the library's potential for web-based graphics.

## Features

- Interactive 3D rendering with Three.js
- Perspective camera setup for realistic depth and viewing angles
- Ambient and point lighting to enhance visual dynamics
- Responsive design compatible with high-resolution displays

Feel free to explore the code and embark on your own 3D web adventures!
